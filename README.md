# BookApp_ReactNative

## ReadBook Mobile Application

PROJECT STILL IN PROGRESS

Language: ReactNative

The project has been implemented as a final project in the Mobile Programming course. The course was completed at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences as part of my degree in Business Information Technology.

Functionalities Used:
- Google Books API interface
- Nesting navigators, Tab, and Stack
- MUI library
 
Functionality of the Application:

Through the application, users can retrieve book information via the Google Books API interface. In the search view, book covers and some details about the books are displayed. Each book can be viewed in more detail by pressing the "read more" button. In this view, more information about the book is available. The description shows the first 300 characters, and by pressing the "show more" button, the remaining text can be revealed. Pressing the "show less" button allows users to condense the description again.
